note that the icons are in a 150x150 grid, and the height is just ignored. only width is taken into account

if you have 1 icon (150x150 image), it'll leave that icon whether winning, losing or neutral
if you have 2 icons (300x150 image), the 1st icon (the left one) is neutral, and the 2nd is losing.
if you have 3 icons (400x150 image), the 1st icon (left one) is losing, the 2nd (middle) is neutral and 3rd (right) is winning
If you have >3 icons (image is >400x150), same rules as the above apply, but everything after the 3rd can only be set in code

if you dont want the icon to be antialiased, that has to be set at compile time in EngineData.hax
